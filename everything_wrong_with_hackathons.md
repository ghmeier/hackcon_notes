Everything Wrong with Hackathons
================================
 - Make friends
 - No experience necessary
 - Do a side project
 - Learn something
 - Projects -> Products
 - Feel connected to mentors
 - Atrition rates
 - Build something at the event
 - Other fields
 - Active outside 1 weekend
 - Part of the community
 - Encourage Exploration
 - Make people never feel like they "aren't good enough"
 - Internship
 - Proud
 - Starts > Wall Street
 - Bond the organizing team
 - Language independant
 - People want to give back
 - Committed organizers

## Part of the community
 - Emphase the importance of giving back.
 - Alumni want to help, but don't know how to help. Maybe have alumni mixers? Send sponsors newsletters?
 - Make friends -> Feel connected to young people.

## Do a side project
 - Make a hacker space for collaboration.
 	- Pitch it to the CS department (or equivalent) to get an area.
 - If you spend 24 hours on it, you thought it was worth, there will be others who think it's worth it.
 	- Make them present and get them going  even if it isn't complete or not that great compared to them.
 
## Build something at the event
 - To get travel reimbursement, you have to build something (submit to ChallengePost).
   	- MAKE THAT CLEAR IN THE BEGINNING.
   	- Doesn't always work; can harm some people.
 - Maybe kill travel imbursements?

## Highlighting the learning aspect of large hackathons
 - Let everyone demo.
 - Split it into two different rounds.
 - ???

## Active outside 1 weekend
 - "We still hack on Monday."
 - For us your club or events for the rest of the year and not just the hackathon.
 - ???

## Make people never feel like they "aren't good enough"
 - Stop labelling hackathons as a competition and are more of a learning experience.
 - Take the technical jargon away from the website.
 - The word hack is intimidating. See "After hours", "DevFest", "Cookies & Code"
 - Have dev classes for beginners, intermediate, advanced. See "No experience necessary" events.
 - "Learn how to build an app in a week, oh, there's also a hackathon at the end."
 - Chill out sessions, but leave it informal.
