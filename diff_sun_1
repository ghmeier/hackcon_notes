How to Diff

We're talking about how to differentiate yourself.

* Hackathons are like startups with a timebomb *
	- fundraising
	- development
	- marketing
	- design
	- product fit

When will things slow down?
	- Things can get harder
	- Sponsors more difficult
	- Then you have to differentiate

Diff
	- Show what's added/removed
	- Too often hackathons are just changing metadata
	- same hackathon different name or location
	- it's hard to just make the event, but we have to try and change.

How can we do that?
	- Embrace constraints
	- look at the things that block you and use that to motivate iteration
	- just like designing within a box.

throw localhost:2015
	- what can you do with what you have?
	- people are going to disagree. you'll have to justify it
	- ask other people to help

Technica: a focus on culture.

What is your diff?
	- give it a real thought.
