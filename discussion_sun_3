People leaving is the biggest killer of student-run events.
	- hearty agreement

How does organization size come into play?
	- bring in someone new each time.
	- directors are young.

		> feeds back into the community
	- directors, volunteers, advisors

	- have a playbook
		> a document going over your role. things that you've known
	 	> go over your mistakes
		* MAKE A PLAYBOOK *

How do you recruit new people?
	- ask professors
	- compartmentalize the parts of a hackathon
	- get people who are interested in their area (business, design, marketing...)
	- talk to TAs who know young students
	- hackathons are a whole different skill set and scale
