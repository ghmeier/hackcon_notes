Backend
=======

 - Website with table numbers so hackers can fill a form for mentors to know where to go.
 - Website -> static
 	- Subdomain: Example, registration.
 - STANDARDIZATION FOR BACKEND SERVICES!
 	- **Action Item:** Talk to MLH (Niko?).
 - Consider creating an internal StackOverflow for giving badges (gamification for getting better mentors).
 - **Action Item:** Have a system with a map system and "discover" people who are working on a project (twitter handle as well).

# How do you manage internal team tasks?
 - Notifsta -> http://notifsta.com/#/
 - Private Github repos with issues; open source later right before the event.
 - Slack
 - Trello
 - JIRA
 - Google Sheets
 - Teams forget to update their issues.
 	- Big facebook group and messenger conversation and a Google Drive folder which you chat about and send links to them in the FB chat.
 - GroupMe
 	- Some teams moved away because sharing code snippets to Slack.

# Day Of
 - Don't use Slack, etc.
 - Get walkie-talkie.
 	- Use codewords to switch channels to a private one.
 - Keep external battery packs for back up with cellphones/walkie-talkie.

# Organizing teams and times
 - One list to rule them all; people will call you and tell you if they can make it or not. <- Not terribly efficient.
 - Get freshman/sorotizes to join and help with service hours.

# Incentivize
 - Get volunteers from clubs and take care of the clubs (via $$?) for getting your volunteers.
 - Get communities/profs to give service hours for helping in a hackathon.

# Mobile applications
 - Pro tip: Submit your mobile app in advance to get approved by the application store you submit to.
 - Guidebook app as a universal one.
 	- May not work, but you end up making it so generic that it doesn't work for every hackathon.

# Challenges when backend developers leave
 - Keep secret keys documented.

# Misc

**Action Item:** Make a backend for the mentorship with a backend of Github Issues so that anyone can mentor (not sponsors).
