Let's have a version control speedtalk!
	so many stuents in their first semesters don't know how to git.
	let's fix that

A prehackathon prep session?
	does a sponsor want to do that? 
	thursday night, speed prep sesh w/ sponsors.

Can we make HackISU more about learning?

Help organizers take care of themselves
	- have scheduled 'on-call' times
	- times when you're expected to be present

Give sponsors a spotlight
	- prepare them for the spotlight.
	- clearly outline how much time sponsors have, and what is allowed

Prizes can be trips or interviews.
	Let companies sponsor prizes, or interviews

Api Speed dating?? if we have enoughi

Mendeley API
a16z - IOWA IS AWESOME LOVE US

Maybe try a "Best ISU Hack"

Can we have topics for the tech talks? or suggest things to sponsors that will be more effective?

Can we have a thursday sponsorship dinner? <- that's a great place to do final prep for mentors and sponsors over last minute questions
