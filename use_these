/* Just some reminders of stuff to use at the next hackathon */

Challenge Post will send reps! Email them

Let's have a version control speedtalk!
	so many stuents in their first semesters don't know how to git.
	let's fix that

A prehackathon prep session?
	does a sponsor want to do that? 
	thursday night, speed prep sesh w/ sponsors.

Can we make HackISU more about learning?

Help organizers take care of themselves
	- have scheduled 'on-call' times
	- times when you're expected to be present

Give sponsors a spotlight
	- prepare them for the spotlight.
	- clearly outline how much time sponsors have, and what is allowed
