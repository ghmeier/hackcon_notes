Mentorship and Learning discussion, Sunday

How can we get beginners comfortable?
	- get alumni to help out
		> Linkedin, email, etc.
	- use sponsor mentors
	- tech talks to teach beginners

Don't try to teach everything overnight.
	- just leave the event with a working project
	- portfolio pages are great.

How to you distinguish mentors from hackers?
	- colored bandanas.
	- wristbands
	- different colored shirts (sponsors, hackers, mentors)
	- CAPES

How did you allocate swag?
	- clear definition coming in of mentor v hacker
	- having peers as mentors can be troublesome
	- workshops are a risk, sometimes they're good but can be a fail

How to make mentors available?
	- online form for mentors
	- app shows available mentors and help requests get divvied out
	- the thread pool, mentors can help with their specific mentors

How do you prepare mentors prior to the event?
	- create a mentors guide.
	- started mentorship discussion with sponsorship
	- push people to bring engineers <- this is big
	- more engineers makes a more successful event
	- differentiate from a career fair
	- let mentors know that being around more is always good.

What about incentivizing mentorship?
	- the best option is telling mentors that helping more is the best values
	- put the mentors with the hackers

Try scheduling engineers to have shifts throuhout the weekend.

What do you think about hackers helping other hackers?
	- Encourage teams and grouping up
	- Try and have advanced people to pair with beginners
	- separate experience with beginners
	- have a public page where people can tag problems for others to help
	- internal stack overflow
	- just make sure people follow up

Adopt a beginner
	- match beginners with emails before the event
		> sort of fell apart after one email

Just use github tickets.

Sometimes you just need to have an ecosystem built up.

Have project speed dating after the keynote.
A team management tool for building an updating team.

Don't worry about bad mentors, things will work out.
	- if they break the code of conduct though, that's an issue

Maybe it would be good to have some example projects to point beginners to. 
	- point mentors to beginners
	- have people for types of projects

Have rooms for different types of hacks
	- webdev, mobile, hardware, etc.
	- put mentors with their strength
	- splitting rooms by subject can help with venues that are spread out

* The best mentors have intrinsic motivation *
	- yay intangibles
	- maybe have mentors lead a workshop in the week coming up
	- but mentor game rooms and food are nice
	- make sure mentors aren't burned out
	- help them take care of themselves
	- SEND PERSONAL THANK YOU'S
	- reimburse mentor's travel rogue
