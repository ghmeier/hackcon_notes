Building hacker community outside of hackathons
Rodney Folz

build a culture of creation on campus
	-building cool shit is a super power

when staring a community, just do it
	- power through
	- people come to events because they're interested in things
	- do things so people can be interested in them
	- evening events, food, advertising

The key is making your events happen
	- add value, that makes community
	- go beyond the info session
	* poster signed by cs faculty * <- that's funny

Don't be alone. have the community yourself while opening it to others
	- everyone wins or loses together.

Bureaucracy is tough
	- load balance around teams not events
	- have a doubly linked list of responsibility
