Lee Felsenstein
Hacking - Technology Development as a Sport

Literally the oldest computer I've ever seen.
	- tiny screen. big box. 23 pounds.

Tech vs Magic.
	What's the process of development?
		- it's all about exploring the unknown
		- extend your limits
	It's all about FLOW
		- from my main man Mihaly <last name too hard>
		- You forget time, place, it's only the groove
		- no worries about economic gain
		- so much of what hacking is pursuing that flow experience
		- when you flow, you forget everything except the hack
		- balance difficulty with ability
			* not too hard that you're frustrated, but not tedious

Hacking as Sport
	Lee is a sportsman, his game is hacking
		- requires socialization (i.e. the community)
		- exhibition (show of your sick nasty skills)
		- mentoring
		- moral development (be a part of society, get ahead ofthe social curve)
	*Fun Fact* Lee made a social network in 1970
