Lee Felsenstein
Hacking - Technology Development as a Sport

Literally the oldest computer I've ever seen.
	- tiny screen. big box. 23 pounds.

Tech vs Magic.
	What's the process of development?
		- it's all about exploring the unknown
		- extend your limits
	It's all about FLOW
		- from my main man Mihaly <last name too hard>
		- You forget time, place, it's only the groove
		- no worries about economic gain
		- so much of what hacking is pursuing that flow experience
		- when you flow, you forget everything except the hack
		- balance difficulty with ability
			* not too hard that you're frustrated, but not tedious

Hacking as Sport
	Lee is a sportsman, his game is hacking
		- requires socialization (i.e. the community)
		- exhibition (show of your sick nasty skills)
		- mentoring
		- moral development (be a part of society, get ahead ofthe social curve)
	*Fun Fact* Lee made a social network in 1970
		- American Radio Relay League people have tight asses.

The hacker league
	Get these outlaws togther
		- exchange info, tech, converences, etc.
	Mentor each other
		- it's a big deal to help each other
		- we can't all do it alone and the community is here to help
	What are the benefits?
		- get ahead of the educational institutions
		- you have people to bounce ideas off of
	Hacking stared coworking
		- suprise, hackers like to be social
		- getting together and nerding out about stuff they like

Hackathons are more than just play
	They are fun though - "Computer Play Parties"
	Tech Dev solves problems. It gets away from the institutionalization of design.
	We don't need to wait to learn and solve problems.
	Staying in school isn't enough
		- learn the tools to get better

Q&A
	What are the core items to learn? 
		- hands on experience making patterns
		- teaching binary with your fingers (each finger is a bit)
		- figure out the patterns.
		- tie it to physical reality
