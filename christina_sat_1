Sympathy - Understand feelings that you aren't having
	- comes of as just "being nice"
Empathy - Feeling the feelings of someone else as someone else
	- makes or breaks experience
	- shows that you really get people

Sympathy & Empathy
	- sympathy is the buzz words, empathy is the action

Narrative Crafting - give people a story to care about for your event
	- creates an experience for attendees
	- write something through the eyes of an attendee team
	- now use that to plan the event
	- allows you to ask if decisions align with the desired expereince
	- sets the messaging tone
		* This tells people how to behave and what to expect *
Code of Conduct
	- have one.
	- use it if you need to kick someone out
	- you can have a conversation about why offenders are breaking the code

How to food.
	food fuels you
		- having good food keeps you going
	veg, vegan, gluten
		- more than lettuce...
	label food with common allergens
		
Experience Crafting
	post speakers as soon as you know
	t-shirts, multiple cuts if possible
	have feminine products in the bathrooms
	advertise through groups who have the same mission
	ask attendees to help clean up

Retro 
	sit on down and go over the event
	look for some feedback
	what worked/didn't and why
	how can we get better for the next one
	ask and listen to the attendees

Barrier Removal
	get rid of as many barriers as possible
	or maybe focus on one or two
		- they can be physical or mental
	get ready to fail. 
		- you can't remove everything or think of every possibility
	be quick to give affirmation
	explicit opt in v. implicit opt out
		- if you want something, you go to it.
		- force people who want something to move to do it
		- don't force people to leave if they want out

Take Care of yourself
	this allows you to be present for others
	if you aren't taking care of you, you can't take care of others

-- Q&A --
	People might not know they're breaking the code of conduct.
