# How do you distinguish  your mentors from your alumni?
 - Colored bandanas.
 - Wristbands
 - Coloured shirts: Sponsors, mentors, hackers, volunteers
 - Capes!

# Swag for mentors, how did you pick those people
 - Mentors sign up before the event. Stay on track to be a mentor.

# How did you find them?
 - Classroom labs with office hours.

# Organizing mentors
 - Number tables; mentors have to take care of areas.
 - Number tables; have an online form that assigns mentors to the table.
 - Online mentors: Lightscale.
 - Ask HH?

# How did you prepare mentors for the event?
 - Handing packets of when mentors should approach people.
 - Mentors guide sent to mentors a week before.

# How to keep mentors stay for the entire event?
 - Talk to people how important it is for them to stay.
 - Don't let them leave at 5pm.
 	- Get them excited to help people (at 2am).

# How do you offer an insentive for the mentors?
 - Incentivize student mentors.
 - May not be good for sponsored mentors; they already have been paid to be there. <- talk to them.
 - Keep the mentors on the same floor/room as the hackers so they don't lose sense of help needed.

# What do you think about hackers helping other hackers?
 - From a hackers perspective, discourage teams of beginner-only teams.
 	- Incentivize teams with prizes that if they have 50 newbies/50 experienced.

# Adopt a beginner program?
 - Second time hackers, put your name and area of experience and put them to email each other pre-event. <- May not work all the time.

# Dealing with bad mentors.
 - Infringing on MLH rules: kick 'em.
 - Bad mentor by technical standards: Teach them how to google.

# Sign up to be mentor/hacker:
 - What happens in practice, experienced wanted to work on their own hacks.
 - Beginners tended to be left behind.
 - Incentive was with swag; people will mentor only for minimum hours. <- Not what they wanted.

# Misc
 - Beginner 101 workshops for how to google & VERY basics of github.
 - "Cortexes" create communities of people in the same room. Mobile room, Web room, etc.
 	- Breaking into groups so create the feeling of smaller hackathons.
 - Incentive with unlimited food?
 	- Send personal thank you cards for mentors (especially who helped a lot).
 - Inform sponsored mentors (providing SDKs) to come prepared with simple empty projects in popular languages/frameworks that have their SDKs setup in it.

> **ACTION ITEM**: Create online form system for the "mentor pool".

> **ACTION ITEM**: Create a tool for team building that's targeted for hackers with no previous experience to match with experienced.
